This is a web app made in Rust for the purposes of a series over on Medium. I will update this README with a link to the article once it is complete. To use this app,
you'll need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). Once you have Rust installed, go to the directory with the repo and run the following
command
```bash
cargo run
```
